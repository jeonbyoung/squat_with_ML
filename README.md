# squat_with_ML
## This is the project analyzing the squat pose with ML and the information of thigh bone.
I gonna analyzing who's squat pose with comparing the bodybuilder or powerweight lifters' poses.

The key point is the ratio of torso and thigh bone(femur). I think the correlationship between the torso length and femur length is the key point of the squat pose, thus I gonna experiment how it works!
